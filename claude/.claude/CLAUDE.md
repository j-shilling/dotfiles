# Personal Claude Code Configuration

This is my personal user-level context for Claude Code across all projects.

## Preferences

- Prefer concise, technical communication
- Focus on practical solutions over theoretical explanations
- When working with my dotfiles, always use stow for installation

## Development Environment

- Primary editor: Emacs with extensive AI integration (GPTel + Claude)
- Shell: bash with multiple language runtime managers
- Language ecosystems: Ruby (RVM), Node.js (NVM), Python (PyEnv), Haskell (GHCup)
- Version control: Git with Magit integration

## Common Patterns

- XDG Base Directory compliance for all configurations
- Modular organization: split large configs into focused files
- Literate programming: documentation lives alongside code
